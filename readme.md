## Description
This is an extension for E2 that allows you to create easy timings for prop engines by
using the elegant dedicated API

## General FAQ:

#### Do you accept donations ?
I am supporting this tool in my free time mostly and it was quite a ride since I already first
created it. But since my lack of time for playing gmod has been drastically increased some
people asked me if I accept donations, here is [the link to my PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/DeyanVasilev).

#### How can I install this ?
You can subscribe to it in the workshop [here](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1493837859)
or clone the general repository from [here](https://github.com/dvdvideo1234/E2PistonTiming) into your addons
folder of the game `../GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons` and you are practically done.

#### I want a feature `X` can I modify your source and add it myself ?
***No***. I constantly develop this extension, so this will result in your clients
using a buggy and outdated version also. Please raise an issue if you want additional
feature so I can make it available for everyone. Don't be an egoist and respect the
one's intellectual property ;)

#### Where can I find additional information about this addon ?
You better try [the WIKI page](https://github.com/dvdvideo1234/E2PistonTiming/wiki). Because the readme is supposed to be short.

#### May I put this thing in another third party website ?
***No I will not give you my permission to do that... Why ...***
That way you will upload some half-baked malicious tool, waste your time with stupid
things and confuse everybody with this so-called `unofficial` version of the E2PistonTiming.
Not to mention that the stunned people ***will NOT GET ANY updates*** !
The best you can do is just point to the [original GIT repository](https://github.com/dvdvideo1234/E2PistonTiming)
avoiding any version mismatches and confusions. So please don't upload the script to any other sites. ***I mean it!***
